# Lab Mission — Enterprise GenAI Architecture & Context Engineering

## Mission
Build and document an enterprise-grade GenAI lab that demonstrates how to design **scalable, governable, production-minded** GenAI systems—focused on **context engineering, retrieval strategy (RAG), controls, and evaluation** rather than model training or novelty demos.

This lab exists to convert architectural thinking and delivery governance into **hands-on, defensible GenAI systems experience**.

## What “Success” Looks Like
This lab is successful when it produces reusable, reviewable artifacts that reflect how GenAI must operate in real enterprise environments:

- A clear **reference architecture** with trust boundaries and control points
- A documented **context assembly pipeline** (role, intent, constraints, policy injection)
- **Tiered retrieval strategies** with source weighting, citation rules, and conflict handling
- **Governance-by-design controls** (RBAC, audit logs, HITL triggers, refusal logic)
- A repeatable **evaluation approach** (hallucination tests, citation accuracy, refusal correctness, drift scenarios)
- Diagrams and docs that a reviewer can understand in **under 10 minutes**

## Scope
### In scope
- LLM-backed Q&A and workflow assistants using enterprise patterns:
  - Context orchestration (role, intent, constraints, policy injection)
  - Retrieval (RAG) with tiering and evidence requirements
  - Guardrails and output classification (informational vs advisory)
  - Auditability and traceability (inputs, sources, versions, timestamps)
  - Evaluation and drift management

### Out of scope (intentional)
- Training or fine-tuning large models
- Benchmark-chasing, novelty prompting, or “prompt hacks”
- Internet-connected agents with autonomous execution authority
- Claims of production deployment or business impact that did not occur

## Design Constraints (Non-Negotiables)
- **LLM is not the source of truth**: enterprise facts must come from approved context
- **Citations are mandatory** for factual or policy-relevant statements
- **Refusal is a feature**: the system must stop when context is missing or conflicting
- **Controls precede capability**: governance and safety patterns are built-in, not bolted-on
- **Artifacts over opinions**: diagrams, docs, tests, and examples are the deliverables

## Primary Use Cases (Lab Scenarios)
This lab simulates realistic enterprise scenarios, such as:
- Policy Q&A with citations and refusal behavior
- Incident / audit analysis support with role-based scope and evidence rules
- Procedural guidance constrained to authoritative documentation
- Change-control summaries with traceability and approval checkpoints

## Intended Audience
- Enterprise AI / GenAI Architects
- Context Engineers / LLM Systems Designers
- AI Governance and Responsible AI practitioners
- Delivery leaders translating AI into operating models
- Hiring managers evaluating system-level AI thinking

## Operating Cadence
- Build incrementally in phases (architecture → context → retrieval → controls → evaluation)
- Document every pattern as if it were going into an architecture review
- Capture failure modes and mitigations explicitly
- Maintain an “audit-ready” narrative: what, why, tradeoffs, and evidence

## Status
Active learning lab. Emphasis is on **clarity, defensibility, and enterprise realism** over speed or completeness.
