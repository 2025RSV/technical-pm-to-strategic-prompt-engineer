# Strategic Prompt Engineering — Enterprise Portfolio
This repository documents my work in **Strategic Prompt Engineering**, focusing on
enterprise-scale GenAI delivery, governance, risk management, and defensible decision-making.

This is not a collection of prompt hacks.
It is a system-level portfolio demonstrating how prompts are:
- Designed
- Governed
- Tested
- Audited
- Operationalized

## Core Principles
- Prompts are governed assets
- AI behavior must be controllable and explainable
- Speed without controls creates enterprise risk
- Ethics and delivery are inseparable

## Repository Structure
- `/prompt-systems` — Versioned prompt architectures
- `/governance` — Risk, audit, and approval artifacts
- `/experiments` — Prompt testing and comparison
- `/decision-logs` — Executive-style decision documentation
- `/frameworks` — Reusable enterprise frameworks
- `/syntheses` — Strategic thought leadership
